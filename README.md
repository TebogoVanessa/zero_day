# Vagrant
## Learning how to code on your computer
Sandboxes are great, but you can also do your ALX assessments on your local computer - having a virtual machine (VM) is the perfect tool for that. For this project we learn how to code on our computers
### Learning objectives
At the end of the project we are expected to know the following:
* What is a virtual machine
* What is Vagrant
* Who wrote Vagrant
* What is Ubuntu
* What does “Ubuntu” mean
* How to use VMs with Vagrant
